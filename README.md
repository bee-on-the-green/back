Don't they say that Google knows you better than you do?

To sumurize my intent, I would like to be able to do complex research whihin an enourmous ammount of data (for example, I would like to be able to take my 
gmail MBOX and manage to get a profile of myself (or other people for that matter).

I have written nearly all the lines for the fun aspect of the project (pop ups with grep),but the real thing is missing. I do not have the "AI" program that would find related data to the chosen keyword.I very much doubt that it is available in Bash but there must be something on Github that would suits my needs.
