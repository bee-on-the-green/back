Don't they say that Google knows you better than you do?

To sumurize my intent, I would like to be able to do complex research whihin an enourmous amount of data (for example, I would like to be able to take my 
Gmail MBOX and manage to get a profile of myself (or other people for that matter).

I have written nearly all the lines for the fun aspect of the project (pop ups with grep), but the real thing is missing. I do not have the "AI" program that would find related data to the chosen keyword. There must be something out there that would suits my needs.

Note: Considering my level,I very doubt that I will achieve my goal but I have decided to give it a shot none the less.
