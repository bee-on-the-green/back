# Computers know better!

Don't they say that Google knows you better than you do?

To sumurize my intent, I would like to be able to "profile" a person using all her/his data (Gmail MBOX, photos,videos, internet history, Youtube visits, movie collections, social media data, etc.)

I would use myself as a guinea pig, with all the data I can gather. It would then be easy to ask peopel who know me well if it is accurate or not).

The user of the program should have the possibility to ask questions (whether general or very specific), and get relevant answers.

At some point, a program able to find 'related content' to various keywords will have to be included, as programs such as Grep are not capable of doing it (at least as far as I know). I am sure there are such things out there, but implementing the whole thing must be difficult for sure (the program would need to be capable of cross referencing data, etc.).

Also, there would be a fun apect to this project: the computer's 'findings' would be displayed as short 'pop-ups' on a secondary screen, a little bit like a screensaver (short video clips, bits of emails/whatsapp, Internet pages, etc.). For example, YouTube pages that have never been visited, like the real thing.

I have very little experience when it comes to scripting. All I managed so far is to write a little interactive .sh script: the user can pick up a word, the word goes through a massive book collection thanks to grep, and a random line pops up on one of my screen thanks to a text editor (the text editor content being refreshed at regular intervals).

I know that this is very basic but it is a great achiemenent, considering my skills, which are extremelly limited (I only use Youtube tutorials, and sometimes ask questions on various forum when I get stuck).  

I hope that I will get a bit of help, should someone find this "profiling things" interrestng or funny.

At any rate, I am aware that this project is very ambitious and difficult but I am going to give it a shot none the less, and go as far as I possibly can.

I am one of these people who were told "learn to code!". Very insulting indeed. But I realized that unbeliable things can be achived with a  bit of knowledge,  (and big efforts to be fair)..; and yes, a lot of people think that Notepad in Windows is a 'Post-it' program, I was one of them not that long ago :)
